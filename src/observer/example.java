	 * Use-Case:
	 * 
	 * A bar has a list of players who wish to play the piano.
	 * They dont want to modify their piano, because there are no inherent rules preventing
	 * anyone from technically playing it. But theyd rather add a set of rules so that
	 * a drunk cant play it.
	 * 
	 * Our Proxy Piano takes in a person with a given BAC. and decides if they can play it or not.
	 * 
	 * This additional task, is then not linked to the Piano itself. 
	 * Which works the same if a drunk plays it or not.
